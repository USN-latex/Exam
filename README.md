# Exam
This is a git repository of the latex template for exam first pages at the University College of Southeast Norway. At present we have the HSN exam in english and bokm√•l. 

## Instructions
If you want to contribute any changes, you first have to become a member of the group, and then an administrator will give you write access. This is absolutely quite easy, and as git is a very good version control system, all changes will be recorded and all old versions will be kept.

To **download** these files, you can just download the latest version of the repository as a zip file. The best way, if you want to make changes to the template. is to have git installed, which is default on all linux systems, and then clone the whole repository to your computer.

## Learning git
If you want to learn git, go to [git-scm.com/doc](https://git-scm.com/doc). It is a powerful tool both for collaboration on programming and writing, and as a tool for yourself to make sure you don't loose data or old versions of texts.
